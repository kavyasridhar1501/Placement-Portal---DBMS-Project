PLACEMENT PORTAL 

The Placement Portal is an application that allows students to sign up, fill out their resume and regularly update it,  and view the details regarding the opportunities that are available to them. They will also be able to view the criteria for selection, salary packages, etc., and filter companies based on the parameters mentioned. Further, this portal will also have a channel for the companies that come to the campus to hire students, where they can list their requirements and the descriptions, and view the studentsâ€™ application details. All of these operations are spearheaded by the Admin who oversees the process and  can add companies and optionally remove students and companies.
	
The details of the alumni who have gotten placed via this portal is made available to anyone who visits the application. This will enable visitors to view their details and gain guidance regarding the same, 
The implementation of this idea is carried out through a trigger that moves the details of the applicant who has been  accepted for a job from the students table to the alumni table, while deleting the records of their other applications to ensure that they are placed only in one job.

The following are the tools that have been utilised to implement this project
Front End - HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery
Backend - PHP, MySQL
Server - XAMPP
